# The openkit-sample currently does not use the public OpenKit-API, but instead it uses internal functions.
# If the OpenKit is built as a shared library, we don't want to export all (internal) symbols.
# Therefore, for the target "openkit-sample", the sources are directly accessed and compiled.
# This is done by making the list of sources available here and creating the releative path with prepend.
